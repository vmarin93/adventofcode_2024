# Advent of Code 2024 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository! This repo contains my solutions to the programming puzzles from [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024). These puzzles are a fun way to practice problem-solving and coding skills during the holiday season.

## 🛠 About

Advent of Code is an annual coding event that runs from December 1st to 25th. Each day features a new two-part puzzle with increasing difficulty. I'll be tackling these challenges using **Python**, focusing on clean, efficient, and well-documented solutions.

## 🚀 Structure of the Repository

The repository is organized as follows:

- Each `dayX/` folder corresponds to a day of Advent of Code and contains:
  - `part1.py`: My Python solution for the first part of the day's puzzle.
  - `part2.py`: My Python solution for the second part of the day's puzzle.

- The `utils/` directory contains reusable helper functions or classes, if applicable.
